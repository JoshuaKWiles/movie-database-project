In the "Friend Like Me" number, both the Genie and the Carpet do the Carlton dance from Will Smith's comedy The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990).
When the Genie shows Aladdin a floating scroll, the drawing contains Aladdin, the Genie, and the Sultan in their animated forms from Aladdin (1992).
Sir Patrick Stewart campaigned for the role of Jafar. He had previously been forced to turn down the role in Aladdin (1992) due to his commitment to Star Trek The Next Generation and has regretted it ever since.
During "A Whole New World", the Carpet flies over the Pridelands of The Lion King (2019).
Frank Welker reprises his role as the Cave of Wonders from the original Aladdin (1992), making him the first cast member from a Disney animated feature to play the same character in the live-action remake. He also voiced Abu and Rajah in the original version. He was followed by James Earl Jones, reprising his role of Mufasa from The Lion King (1994) in the CGI remake The Lion King (2019). Alan Tudyk was brought on for his eighth Disney film as Iago in this version. Jim Cummings reprised his roles as the voices of Pooh and Tigger in Christopher Robin (2018), which is a live-action adaptation of the Winnie the Pooh cartoons, but that movie served as a follow-up of the franchise instead of a direct remake of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977).
